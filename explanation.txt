The function 'characterOccurrences' takes a string 'inputString' as an argument and returns a map where the keys are char and the values are integers.

1. 'counts := make(map[rune]int)': This line initializes a new map 'counts' where the keys are char and the values are integers. This map will be used to store the count of each character in the string 'inputString'.

2. 'for _, char := range inputString': This line starts a for loop that iterates over each character 'char' in the string 'inputString'. 

3. 'counts[char]++': Increments the corresponding entry in the map 'counts'. If the character does not exist in the map, it gets added with a count of 1. If it does exist, its count gets incremented by 1.

4. 'return counts': After all characters in the string have been processed, the function returns the map 'counts', which now contains the count of each character in the string.
